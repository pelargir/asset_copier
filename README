= asset_copier_generator

Intelligent asset management for Rails plugins.

== Installation
 
Install the gem directly:

  gem sources -a http://gems.github.com (you only have to do this once)
  sudo gem install pelargir-asset_copier

Or clone the project, build the gem, and install:

  git clone git://github.com/pelargir/asset_copier.git
  gem build asset_copier_generator.gemspec
  sudo gem install asset_copier_generator

== Usage

asset_copier_generator will copy the necessary files into a target plugin
to enable intelligent asset management. You should then check these files in
to source control. The generated files become a part of your plugin.

To install the files in your plugin, first ensure that your plugin is installed
or symlinked from an existing Rails app. From the root of that Rails app, run:

  script/generate asset_copier plugin_name
  
Where "plugin_name" is the name of the plugin you want to install into. The
appropriate files will be copied into your plugin. Now, to copy assets
from your plugin into your Rails app, run:

  rake plugin_name:install

Your users can run this same Rake task any time they want to update files
in their Rails app to reflect the assets needed by your plugin.
