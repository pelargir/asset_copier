# Generated by the asset_copier plugin
# http://github.com/pelargir/asset_copier
#
# Files that have been removed from the plugin and should also be removed from
# any Rails projects that use the plugin should be listed here, one entry
# per line. For example:
#
#   public/javascripts/foo.js
#   app/views/foo/bar.erb.html
#
# Adding the paths above to this file would ensure that foo.js and bar.erb.html
# both get removed from the target Rails project the next time the plugin's
# files are copied over.
